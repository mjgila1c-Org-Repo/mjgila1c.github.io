#Suzuki Piano Kids
# <code.> Louisville Front End Development Project </h1>

# My project is a blog for parents trying to teach their kids to play piano through the suzuki method.

# My hope is to create a better community of parents and teach to help each other learn new approaches to teach, encouraging and motivating your child through this difficult process.
